# LexSALDO
This is a project to analyze and add identifiers for words 
from SALDO to Wikidata.

## TODO
* investigate if a unique identifier is present for both entries and senses.

## API
An API has been added for easy lookup. The goal is to upload it to Toolforge to facilitate
integration of the data into Wikidata via a property since 
this might be a good freely licensed source for Swedish lexemes to use.

## Versioning
The output jsonl is versioned v1, v2, etc.
The latest number is always consistent with the model in the code, 
old versions are kept for backwards compatibility.

## Statistics
